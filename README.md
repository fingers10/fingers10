I'm an trust worthy, lazy and young self-taught technology lover who likes to architecture and work on bleeding edge technologies. Accomplished secure software developer with more than 6 years of experience in development using Microsoft Tech Stack - .NET and popular front end Tech Stack like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

I make it my mission and help corporates, start-ups, non-profits, open-source to convert their business/ideas into Robust, Accessible and Secure Software Products by providing top notch service and help them survive in their business with success.

Whether it's Technology Consultation, Software Development, Solution Architecture, Technology Teaching, I take pride in providing best service in record time while leading with kindness.

I have Extensive experience on web based applications built in Microsoft technologies. Hands on experience in working on projects as well as products. Software development experience include developing:

I love to make things of my own. My interests revolves on Designing UI and code base (mainly). But also I know my way around Programming, Websites and Web Applications Design and Architecture using Microsoft Server Side Technologies along with Technical Learning and Teaching.

When I'm not doing anything above you can find me exploring the world and enjoying the time with my family.
